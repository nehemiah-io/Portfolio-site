		 <p>Hell and welcome to my site it's a bit low on things right now, but more is always coming and going to be put here soon. I'm a software engineer and if you are looking for a webdev of any kind don't look any further, especially when it comes to game development. Although the site has very little enjoy some of the small games I've made and put on here to stop the undying boredom. </p>
